Currently, an assistant professor in the Faculty of Science and Engineering at the University of Groningen. Member of the [Software Engineering and Architecture](http://www.cs.rug.nl/search/Main/HomePage) group, led by [Paris Avgeriou](http://www.cs.rug.nl/~paris/).

My research interests lie in software quality, source code analysis, and software architecture, and have progressively expanded with a particular emphasis on automation within software projects. My work aims to reflect on the intersection (often seen as a gap) between software architecture and source code. Here is an overview of my current research areas:

1. **Automation in Software Projects**:
   A significant focus of my research is on automating various aspects of software projects. This includes automating technical debt management, code and architectural analysis, and other processes to enhance efficiency. My work in this area aims to develop tools and methods that reduce manual effort and improve decision-making in software development.

2. **Technical Debt Management**:
   I am interested in technical debt (TD) as a metaphor to enable software maintenance and evolution, with a recent focus on automating TDM tasks. This research addresses the need for efficient strategies to manage TD, a critical aspect of the long-term sustainability of software systems.

3. **Software Quality Analysis**:
   Stemming from my doctoral research, I continue working on energy efficiency, both as an isolated concern (e.g., in ML-enabled applications) and as a performance metric to be balanced with design qualities such as maintainability and reusability.

I actively seek collaborations and discussions in these areas and am enthusiastic about engaging with both academic and industrial communities. If you are interested in my work, please get in touch!
