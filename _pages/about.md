Currently, an assistant professor in Campus Frysl√¢n at the University of Groningen, member of the [Data Research Centre](https://www.rug.nl/cf/onderzoek-gscf/research/research-centres/dataresearchcentre/), led by [Anne Beaulieu](https://annebeaulieu.org/), and guest researcher at the [Software Engineering and Architecture](http://www.cs.rug.nl/search/Main/HomePage) group, led by [Paris Avgeriou](http://www.cs.rug.nl/~paris/).

My research interests lie in software architecture and software quality and are commonly applied to HW/SW co-design, although I also address other software-intensive systems.
I have initially focused on reference architectures and reusable components for mobile robot systems. Later, I delved into architectural and design problems.

During my doctoral project, I investigated the challenges of the interplay between the run-time constraints imposed by embedded hardware (e.g., performance and energy consumption) and design-time quality attributes (e.g., maintainability and reusability) necessary for the smooth evolution of the system. In this line, I worked on software quality as measured by static and dynamic analysis, and explored design patterns as a means to manage the trade-off between such quality attributes. Recently, I have also investigated frameworks as a means to design high-quality IoT applications with the potential to accommodate a variety of vendors. However, as reuse may bring concerns such as vulnerabilities, my interest has also been drawn into the investigation of security constraints in reuse.

Due to my work on software quality, I am also interested in technical debt (TD) as a proxy to monetize architectural and design decisions. So far, I have studied TD Python open-source projects, and I started to look into particularities of TD accumulation and management in co-designed systems.
