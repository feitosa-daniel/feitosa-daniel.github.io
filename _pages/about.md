Currently, an assistant professor in the Faculty of Science and Engineering at the University of Groningen. Member of the [Software Engineering and Architecture](http://www.cs.rug.nl/search/Main/HomePage) group, led by [Paris Avgeriou](http://www.cs.rug.nl/~paris/).

My research interests lie in software quality, source code analysis, and software architecture.
My work aims to reflect on the intersection (often seen as a gap) between software architecture and source code.

During my doctoral project, I investigated the challenges of the interplay between the run-time constraints imposed by embedded hardware (e.g., performance and energy consumption) and design-time quality attributes (e.g., maintainability and reusability) necessary for the smooth evolution of the system. In this line, I worked on software quality as measured by static and dynamic analysis, and explored design patterns as a means to manage the trade-off between such quality attributes. Recently, I have also investigated frameworks as a means to design high-quality IoT applications with the potential to accommodate a variety of vendors. However, as reuse may bring concerns such as vulnerabilities, my interest has also been drawn into the investigation of security constraints in reuse.

In recent years, I have also vested in technical debt (TD) as a metaphor to monetize architectural and design decisions and, more importantly, serve as a common language among software development stakeholders and for decision-making. So far, I have studied TD in Python open-source projects and how they compare to TD accumulated in Java systems, as well as phenomena such as self-fixed technical debt.
